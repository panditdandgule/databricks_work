# Databricks Code Practice

### Get fluent in Databricks by typing, not watching.

**104 exercises + 5 production-grade pipeline labs. All on Databricks Free Edition.**

Clone once, import into Databricks, pick a folder. Exercises fail loud until your code is right; labs ship with synthetic data so you build production-style pipelines, not toy ones.

> **New (18 April 2026):** 5 full-scale pipeline labs + 1 benchmark deep-dive just landed. If you starred this repo for the exercises, they're still here - now alongside end-to-end project work.

## What's Inside

Fluency comes from reps, not reading. Three structured paths:

- **`exercises/`** - focused reps on a single concept. LeetCode-style, 5-30 min each.
- **`pipeline-labs/`** - end-to-end medallion pipelines on a business scenario. 2-3 hours each.
- **`deep-dives/`** - measure the impact of a technique with numbers. 1-2 hours each.

| **Scope**     | One concept (MERGE, window functions, ...) | End-to-end project (ingestion -> bronze -> silver -> gold)       | One topic measured in depth                             |
